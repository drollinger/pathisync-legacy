# LEGACY SYNC HAS BEEN IMPROVED, PLEASE SEE pathisync REPO FOR MORE INFO
# Pathify Flow Local Integration Sync
Description: Library of all widget files for pathify along with sync scripts between local dev and pathify production server.

# Note
The intended course of development is for this to become a node package you install into your repository that only contains your pathify configs/code. However, currently it's just in a very early stage to see if it's useful or not. There are several features in mind that might or might not get built out. If you want to add your own features then feel free to fork and send a pull request. 

## Setting up local environment
1. Generate a token from pathify by visiting https://\<Your Flow Domain\>/auth/s2s/token/create
    - Ensure you are logged in before visiting the page
    - By default, these tokens have a 30 day expiry
2. Change the name of cred.token.example to cred.token and paste in your token

## Running the sync
1. To sync flows, resources, shard configs, and triggers, use the command `npm run all`
2. If there is anything out of sync with the server, a prompt will appear explaining differences and possible solutions

## Notes about syncing
- Widget files are located in the pathify folder under their respective folder name
- Flows, shared configs, and triggers only consist of a single widget file. These files must be named the same as the id/name in their file and end with .json
- Resources consist of a folder with the same name as the collection id and inside of that folder, a \_collection.json widget file
- Each resource must be located in the same location and under the same file name listed in the resourceAccessorPath. This location is relative to the base folder for that collection
- Single widget files and collection folders can be sorted into nesting folders within there respective folders
- A new resource that isn't listed on prod nor in \_collection.json will not show up while syncing. To sync a new local resource, add it to the \_collection.json resources list with appropriate configuration fields

## Debugging scripts
- There is a vscode debug script labeled `Current TS File` which will run and debug whichever file you have pulled up. The main script which runs all sync scripts is syncAll.ts

## Dictionary
- widget file: All inclusive term for any flow, shared config, trigger, or resource used by pathify's system
- collection: A grouping of resources bound under the same \_collection.json file
- prod/server: Refers to the pathify flow server where widget files are used in the live production environment
